                        Hi there! My name is Irinel Bandas, and I have developed this website to show some of my video editing skills.
                        While my main focus is areas in Computer Science, I also have a hobby of creating video edits.
                        Most of these video edits are focused on Esports gaming as of now, but I also have interest in
                        creating video edits for fitness too. The purpose of my video edits have always been
                        about getting people excited, and I hope to keep doing so!
                        </p>
