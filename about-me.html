                    Hi there, my name is Irinel Bandas! I am an SRE during the day and a Masters in Computer Science student
                    at Northwestern University... also during the day. Currently I am striving to become a better
                    engineer by doing work and school at the same time. Learning everything from DevOps/SRE to Machine Learning and AI.
                    </p>

                        However, I created this portfolio to show off another skill of mine: Video Editing.
                        I mainly do video editing as a hobby on the side. I loved watching video edits
                        growing up, whether it was fan made on youtube or a well created scene in a 
                        TV show. I knew that I wanted to be able to create videos that could make someone
                        feel what I was portraying, much like the video edits I grew up on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio-info">
                        I hope you enjoy the videos I have created so far! You can click the Youtube link
                        at the top to view more videos of mine, and if you want to connect, you can scroll down
                        for my contact information!
