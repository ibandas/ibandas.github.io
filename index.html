                    This video was created before the League of Legends 2017 Summer Playoffs.
                    I wanted to utilize the song Legend by The Score, because I felt that it
                    fit perfectly with the narrative of all the teams that were in the playoffs,
                    and how badly all of them wanted to win it. My goal with this video was
                    to get people excited for the playoffs and remember all the great
                    moments that led up to this moment.</p>

                    This was one of my first videos that I had ever created.
                    With Team Solomid being one of my favorite teams, I wanted to create a video
                    that immortalized the current roster. It was a super team that had been created,
                    but from the beginning had many challenges. I wanted to show the journey of the team,
                    who started off favorites in the pre-season and then underdogs going into the playoffs
                    who had now made it to the finals. This video was to inspire the fans before their finals.
